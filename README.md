# password-manager

Just a little password manager app I made. This app is pretty straightforward. You enter in a website and the email and password you want to use for the
website. This information is then added into a "data.json" file. 

If you ever want to retrieve the information you entered for a specific website, just type that webite into the website input box and click the "Search"
button. A dialog box will popup with the information. 

If you try to enter information while leaving any of the input boxes empty, you will get an error. If you try to search for information for a website you
have never used before, you will, of course, not receive any information back.
